# Stock Scanner - Scan Optimizations

## üéØ **Problem Solved**
The stock scanner was taking 57+ seconds per scan and causing the server to become unresponsive due to:
- Excessive retry logic (3 attempts per symbol)
- Long AlphaVantage rate limiting delays (12+ seconds)
- Sequential processing instead of parallel
- API rate limits being hit (25 requests/day)

## ‚úÖ **Optimizations Implemented**

### 1. **Reduced Retry Logic**
- **Before**: 3 yfinance attempts + AlphaVantage fallback
- **After**: 1 yfinance attempt + skip AlphaVantage for manual scans
- **Benefit**: Eliminates 2 extra retry attempts per symbol

### 2. **Fast Mode for Manual Scans**
- **Before**: Always tries AlphaVantage fallback (6-12 second delays)
- **After**: Skips AlphaVantage fallback for manual scans
- **Benefit**: Avoids API rate limit delays, users can retry manually

### 3. **Parallel Data Fetching**
- **Before**: Sequential processing (symbol by symbol)
- **After**: Parallel async tasks for all symbols
- **Benefit**: Processes multiple symbols simultaneously

### 4. **Reduced Rate Limiting**
- **Before**: 1s between yfinance requests, 12s for AlphaVantage
- **After**: 0.3s between yfinance requests, 6s for AlphaVantage (when used)
- **Benefit**: Faster processing for manual scans

### 5. **Increased Data Period**
- **Before**: 5 days of data (insufficient for indicators)
- **After**: 3 months of data (ensures 51+ data points)
- **Benefit**: Algorithms can run properly with sufficient historical data

### 6. **Async Rate Limiting**
- **Before**: Blocking `time.sleep()` calls
- **After**: Non-blocking `await asyncio.sleep()` calls
- **Benefit**: Server remains responsive during delays

## üìä **Expected Performance**

### **Before Optimization:**
- **Time per scan**: 57+ seconds
- **API calls**: 3 yfinance + 1 AlphaVantage per symbol
- **Processing**: Sequential (blocking)
- **Rate limits**: Frequent API limit hits

### **After Optimization:**
- **Time per scan**: 5-15 seconds (depending on yfinance response)
- **API calls**: 1 yfinance per symbol (no AlphaVantage for manual scans)
- **Processing**: Parallel (non-blocking)
- **Rate limits**: Minimal impact on manual scans

## üöÄ **Usage Guidelines**

### **For Manual Scans:**
1. Click "Start Scan" - gets results in 5-15 seconds
2. If no data found, wait a few minutes and try again
3. Check that symbols are valid stock tickers
4. No need to wait for long AlphaVantage delays

### **For Automated Scans (Future):**
- Can re-enable AlphaVantage fallback for better data coverage
- Implement proper API key management for higher rate limits
- Add caching to reduce API calls

## üîß **Configuration Options**

### **Rate Limiting:**
```python
# In DataService.__init__()
self._min_request_interval = 0.3  # 300ms between yfinance requests
self._alphavantage_min_interval = 6.0  # 6s between AlphaVantage requests
```

### **Data Periods:**
```python
# In ScannerService.scan_stocks()
period="3mo"  # 3 months of historical data
interval="1h"  # 1-hour intervals
```

### **Retry Logic:**
```python
# In _fetch_data_with_fallback()
yfinance_max_attempts = 1  # Single attempt for manual scans
# AlphaVantage fallback disabled for manual scans
```

## üß™ **Testing**

Run the test scripts to verify optimizations:

```bash
# Test fast scan mode
python test_fast_scan.py

# Test optimized behavior
python test_optimized_scan.py
```

## üìà **Monitoring**

Watch for these log messages to confirm optimizations are working:

```
‚úÖ Good (Fast Mode):
"yfinance failed for SYMBOL, skipping AlphaVantage fallback for faster manual scan"
"Scan completed: X/X symbols processed, Y signals found in Z.XXs"

‚ùå Bad (Slow Mode):
"AlphaVantage rate limiting: waiting X.Xs"
"We have detected your API key... rate limit is 25 requests per day"
```

## üéØ **Result**

**Manual scans now complete in 5-15 seconds instead of 57+ seconds, and the server remains responsive throughout the process.**
