# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing scan history functionality by providing comprehensive diagnostic details for each scan run. Users need detailed visibility into what symbols were scanned, what settings were used, what data was successfully retrieved, and what failed - all presented in an intuitive, collapsible interface. This builds upon the existing diagnostic infrastructure to provide actionable insights for troubleshooting and performance analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see detailed scan settings for each historical run, so that I can understand what parameters were used and replicate successful configurations.

2. WHEN expanding scan settings THEN the system SHALL show all algorithm parameters: ATR multiplier, EMA thresholds, volatility filter, FOMO filter, and higher timeframe period
3. WHEN displaying settings THEN the system SHALL format values with appropriate units and precision (e.g., "ATR Multiplier: 2.0x", "EMA5 Rising: 0.1%")
4. WHEN settings differ from defaults THEN the system SHALL highlight modified parameters with visual indicators
5. WHEN comparing runs THEN the system SHALL allow users to easily identify which settings changed between scans

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see which symbols were scanned and their individual outcomes, so that I can identify which stocks are consistently problematic or successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing scan history THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible "Symbols Scanned" section showing total count and breakdown
2. WHEN expanding symbols section THEN the system SHALL categorize symbols by status: "Successful", "No Data", "Insufficient Data", "API Errors"
3. WHEN displaying symbol lists THEN the system SHALL show symbols as clickable badges with color coding: green (success), yellow (warnings), red (errors)
4. WHEN clicking a symbol badge THEN the system SHALL show detailed information: data points received, timeframe coverage, and specific error messages
5. WHEN symbols have partial data THEN the system SHALL indicate which timeframes succeeded/failed (1m vs 15m)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see data quality metrics for each scan, so that I can assess the reliability of the results and identify data issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing scan history THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible "Data Quality" section with key metrics
2. WHEN expanding data quality THEN the system SHALL show: total data points fetched, data fetch time, algorithm processing time, and success rate percentage
3. WHEN data quality is poor THEN the system SHALL highlight issues with warning indicators and explanatory tooltips
4. WHEN displaying timing metrics THEN the system SHALL show performance breakdown: "Data Fetch: 2.1s, Algorithm: 0.3s, Total: 2.4s"
5. WHEN comparing scans THEN the system SHALL allow users to identify performance trends and data quality patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see detailed error information for failed symbols, so that I can understand what went wrong and take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN symbols fail processing THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible "Error Details" section
2. WHEN expanding error details THEN the system SHALL group errors by type: "API Timeouts", "Insufficient Data", "Invalid Tickers", "Market Closed"
3. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL provide actionable descriptions: "ZS: No 1-minute data available (market closed)", "INVALID: Ticker not found"
4. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN the system SHALL suggest remediation steps: "Retry during market hours", "Check ticker symbol"
5. WHEN multiple symbols have the same error THEN the system SHALL group them together with expandable lists

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see signal generation results with context, so that I can understand why certain signals were or weren't generated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing scan results THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible "Signal Analysis" section
2. WHEN expanding signal analysis THEN the system SHALL show: signals found count, symbols that met partial criteria, and rejection reasons
3. WHEN signals were found THEN the system SHALL display signal details: symbol, signal type (long/short), confidence metrics, and key indicator values
4. WHEN symbols were rejected THEN the system SHALL show rejection reasons: "Failed FOMO filter", "EMA not rising", "No HTF confirmation"
5. WHEN no signals were found THEN the system SHALL provide summary of why: "3 symbols failed data fetch, 2 failed EMA criteria, 1 failed HTF confirmation"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see system performance metrics for each scan, so that I can monitor application health and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing scan history THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible "Performance Metrics" section
2. WHEN expanding performance metrics THEN the system SHALL show: memory usage, API rate limit status, concurrent requests, and cache hit rates
3. WHEN performance is degraded THEN the system SHALL highlight bottlenecks with warning indicators
4. WHEN displaying timing breakdowns THEN the system SHALL show per-phase timing: "Symbol validation: 0.1s, Data fetch: 2.0s, Algorithm: 0.3s"
5. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL display rate limit status and estimated reset time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trader, I want an intuitive interface for exploring diagnostic details, so that I can quickly find relevant information without being overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing scan history THEN the system SHALL display summary cards with expandable sections using accordion-style UI
2. WHEN expanding sections THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations and maintain scroll position
3. WHEN displaying large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtualization for symbol lists
4. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for touch interaction with appropriate spacing
5. WHEN searching within diagnostics THEN the system SHALL provide filter and search capabilities for symbols and errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to export diagnostic data, so that I can perform offline analysis and share information with support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing detailed diagnostics THEN the system SHALL provide export options for CSV and JSON formats
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all diagnostic fields: settings, symbols, errors, timing, and performance metrics
3. WHEN exporting multiple scans THEN the system SHALL allow bulk export with date range selection
4. WHEN generating exports THEN the system SHALL format data for easy analysis in spreadsheet applications
5. WHEN exports are large THEN the system SHALL provide download progress indicators and chunked downloads

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to compare diagnostic data between scans, so that I can identify what changes led to different outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting multiple scans THEN the system SHALL provide a comparison view highlighting differences
2. WHEN comparing settings THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side parameter differences with change indicators
3. WHEN comparing symbol outcomes THEN the system SHALL highlight symbols that changed status between scans

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to filter and search scan history, so that I can quickly find specific runs or patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing scan history THEN the system SHALL provide filters for: date range, scan status, symbol count, and execution time
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL allow text search across symbols, error messages, and settings
3. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL update results in real-time with result count indicators
4. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL display active filter badges with clear options
